      <h1>Freebites Community Guidelines</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 5/13/2024</p>
      <h2>The Short</h2>
      <p>
        Freebites is a platform for sharing food opportunities at Tufts while
        maintaining a respectful environment. Post accurate food details, avoid
        spamming or impersonation, and respect others' rights and privacy. Don't
        engage in illegal activities, and report any violations to help keep the
        community safe.
      </p>
      <h2>The Long</h2>
      <p>
        Freebites is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages,
        and beliefs. We've spent a lot of time thinking about the different
        points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and
        protect this amazing community. By using Freebites, you agree to these
        guidelines. We're committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too.
        Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled
        accounts, or other restrictions.
      </p>
      <h3>Be thoughtful when posting food opportunities.</h3>
      <p>
        We recognize that Freebites is a platform where users come together to
        share valuable food-related information. While we encourage this
        exchange, it's important to be mindful of the content you share,
        especially considering the diverse audience that uses our platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        When posting food opportunities, ensure that the photos accurately
        represent the items available and include relevant information such as
        descriptions, filters, location details, and the current status of the
        food (through the live thread). Deceptive practices or misleading
        information can harm the trust within our community and may lead to the
        removal of such content and account. There's no tolerance for
        objectionable content or abusive users. Users can flag objectionable
        content and block abusive users if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.</h3>
      <p>
        Help us stay
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/spam">spam-free</a>
        by not artificially collecting comments and attention or posting
        repetitive comments or content. You don't have to use your real name on
        Freebites, but we do require Freebites users to provide us with accurate
        anulad up to date information. Don't
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/misrepresentation"
          >impersonate</a
        >
        others and don't create accounts for the purpose of violating our
        guidelines or
        <a
          href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/inauthentic-behavior/"
          >misleading others</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Follow the law.</h3>
      <p>
        Freebites is dedicated to promoting a safe and positive environment for
        sharing food opportunities within the Tufts community. Therefore, we
        strictly prohibit any form of malicious commentary, including support or
        praise for
        <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations"
          >terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups.</a
        >
        Additionally, content related to offering sexual services, offering
        firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products among individuals, as well as
        the postings of non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs, is strictly
        prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not tolerate any attempts to coordinate the trade or distribution
        of non-medical drugs, nor do we allow content that promotes their use.
        Furthermore, the offerings of live animals between private individuals
        is not permitted on Freebites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always ensure that any content you post on Freebites complies with the
        law. Avoid sharing inaccurate or unreliable food availability, as this
        undermines the trust and integrity of our community. We are committed to
        maintaining a zero-tolerance policy
      </p>
      <p>
        regarding the sharing of sexual content or threats to post
        <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/sexual_exploitation_adults"
          >intimate images</a
        >
        of others.
      </p>

      <h3>Respect other members of the Freebites community.</h3>
      <p>
        We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that
        contains
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence"
          >credible threats</a

        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/bullying"
          >degrade or shame them</a
        >, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and
        repeated unwanted messages.<br />
        It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their
        race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual
        orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases.

          >Serious threats of harm</a
        >
        to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific
        threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and
        other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and
        consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.

      <h3>Help us keep the community strong.</h3>

      <p>
        Each of us is an important part of the Freebites community. If you see
        something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by
        using our built-in reporting option. We have a team that reviews these
        reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn't
        meet our guidelines. When you complete the report, try to provide as
        much information as possible, such as the specific elements of the post
        that generated discomfort and your rationales, so we can review it
        quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated
        captions violate our guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there's
        risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.
      </p>

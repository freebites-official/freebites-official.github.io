      <h2>The Short</h2>
      <p>
        Freebites is a platform for sharing food opportunities at Tufts while
        maintaining a respectful environment. Post accurate food details, avoid
        spamming or impersonation, and respect others' rights and privacy. Don't
        engage in illegal activities, and report any violations to help keep the
        community safe.
      </p>

      <h2>The Long</h2>
      <p>
        Freebites is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages,
        and beliefs. We've spent a lot of time thinking about the different
        points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and
        protect this amazing community. By using Freebites, you agree to these
        guidelines. We're committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too.
        Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled
        accounts, or other restrictions.
      </p>

      <h3>Be thoughtful when posting food opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        We recognize that Freebites is a platform where users come together to
        share valuable food-related information. While we encourage this
        exchange, it's important to be mindful of the content you share,
        especially considering the diverse audience that uses our platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        When posting food opportunities, ensure that the photos accurately
        represent the items available and include relevant information such as
        descriptions, filters, location details, and the current status of the
        food (through the live thread). Deceptive practices or misleading
        information can harm the trust within our community and may lead to the
        removal of such content and account. There's no tolerance for
        objectionable content or abusive users. Users can flag objectionable
        content and block abusive users if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions</h3>
      <p>
        Help us stay

          href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/spam/"

        by not artificially collecting comments and attention or posting
        repetitive comments or content. You don't have to use your real name on
        Freebites, but we do require Freebites users to provide us with accurate
        anulad up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create
        accounts for the purpose of violating our guidelines or

          >misleading others.</a
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Follow the law</h3>
      <p>
        Freebites is dedicated to promoting a safe and positive environment for
        sharing food opportunities within the Tufts community. Therefore, we
        strictly prohibit any form of malicious commentary, including support or
        praise for
        <a
          href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations"
          >terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups.</a
        >
        Additionally, content related to offering sexual services, offering
        firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products among individuals, as well as
        the postings of non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs, is strictly
        prohibited.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not tolerate any attempts to coordinate the trade or distribution
        of non-medical drugs, nor do we allow content that promotes their use.
        Furthermore, the offerings of live animals between private individuals
        is not permitted on Freebites.

        <br />
        <br />
        Always ensure that any content you post on Freebites complies with the
        law. Avoid sharing inaccurate or unreliable food availability, as this
        undermines the trust and integrity of our community. We are committed to
        maintaining a zero-tolerance policy regarding the sharing of sexual
        content or threats to post
        <a
          href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/adult-sexual-exploitation/"
          >intimate images</a
        >
        of others.

        contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private
        individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to
        blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages.
